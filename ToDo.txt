The flow is:
collect space junk > process > separate > store 
    > craft > attach modules to station or sell them



C U R R E N T
> Can add objects to empty equipment sqaures, however
    they aren't updating station resources or altering
    stats (like storage)
> Make inventory stacks subjective with count values for
    differrent items (in progress)


N E X T
> Make storage bag give a choice for which storage to
    increase
> Make equipment modules uninstallable - repackage?
> Add station inventory to resource stuff at top
> Add manual save button, import-export functionality?
> Add import functionality using spacex transport costs
    > More modules?
    > More equipment?
    > Food, water, air?
> Fix temporality - seconds is tooooo short
> Add crafting recipes

Will need a supply of food, O2, water. Expensive! $$$$$
>> This should drive the player to think about growing food,
    recycling
>> Resource usage should be negative to start, implying the 
    need to import resources
>> improved with a docking module, robot arm
>> Improve tooltip layouts
> Can I highlight empty equipment squares that are
    'droppable' when a piece of equipment is dragged out of
    station inventory?
> Should using food or other materials generate plastic trash?
